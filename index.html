<h1>The Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>

<p><b>The Marvel Cinematic Universe</b> (<i>MCU for short</i>) is a global entertainment franchise that has been at the center of popular culture for over a decade now.
Starting with <em>IRON MAN</em>, this franchise has made huge amounts of money. Though, in the current day, we are stating to see fall of this massive empire. Audiences are
starting to turn towards other franchises and IPs, a sign of superhero fatigue. In this webpage, I will be illustrating the history of not only the MCU, but as well as
the comics that formed the foundation of this media empire.</p>
